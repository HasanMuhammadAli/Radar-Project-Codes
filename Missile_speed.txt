Missile Speed Detection Using Doppler Shift – Concept
This simulation shows how a radar detects a missile's speed using the Doppler effect.
A missile is moving toward a radar, starting at 300 m/s with 10 m/s² acceleration.
Doppler shift occurs when radar waves bounce off the moving missile, changing frequency.

Using the formula:
true_velocities = initial_velocity + acceleration * time_points
measured_doppler_shifts = (2 * true_velocities * f_transmit) / c
estimated_velocities = (measured_doppler_shifts * c) / (2 * f_transmit)


The program compares:
Actual missile speed (from physics)
Estimated speed (from Doppler shift)
