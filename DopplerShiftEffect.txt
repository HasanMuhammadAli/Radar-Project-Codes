Understanding the Doppler Shift Effect
The Doppler effect is the change in frequency (or wavelength) of a wave due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.

Doppler Effect in Radar Systems
When an object moves towards a radar, the frequency of the received signal increases.

When an object moves away from a radar, the frequency of the received signal decreases.

For a radar system, the Doppler shift frequency is given by:
𝑓doppler = (2 × 𝑣 × 𝑓transmit)/𝑐

Where:

𝑓doppler = Doppler frequency shift (Hz)
𝑣 = Velocity of the moving object (m/s)
𝑓transmit = Transmitted frequency (Hz)
𝑐 = Speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s)
