Concepts Involved:
1. Doppler Effect (Radar Version)
    When a wave-emitting object moves toward an observer, the frequency appears increased. For radar, the Doppler frequency shift is calculated using:

    velocities = initial_velocity + acceleration * time_points

2. Kinematic Equations
    Used to model motion of the missile with constant acceleration:
â€‹    
    Velocity over time:
    v=vo+at

    Distance from radar (missile is approaching, so distance reduces):
    distances = initial_distance - (initial_velocity * time_points + 0.5 * acceleration * time_point^2)
